If I wanted instances of transliterated pie characters in the form of pie than I'd have a csv file of that? \n\noh sweet, all my trauma setting up mkdocs is now paying off now because I already have wget and homebrew\n\nwget was so fun and holy crap, it worked the first time\n\nsplitting the output.txt file kicked out an error, I'm also not motivated to do anything with it yet because i don't really have a keen interest in what I searched. I'll revisit this later.\n\n\nThoughts so far\n\n\nI really liked the neat stuff pandocs with the .bib files but I'm confused on how to get this to work in my open notebook. \n\nAlso I don't like that urls do not translate from running the mkdocs to build my web facing open notebook\n\nI'm a bit overwhelmed with the options. Just choosing a text editor alone seems to be an irrelevant yet overwhelming decision. I have always liked TextMate but it wasn't one of the options. Does it matter? It seems to work fine...so far. But people seem to be religious about their text editors. And that's just the mundane and simple task of creating text files. There seem to be an infinite number of other options for the web publishing. We are using mkdocs but could @getgrav also work? Is bootstrap only the styling or is there something there that could help me create. \n\nAlso confused about using gitbub.io page vs my own domain. Should I be doing a push to my github and ghpage and my domain as well? Why so many places? \n\nDid I miss when we were supposed to install omeka? The resources section in slack have a lot of cool and interesting information but it's difficult to discern necessary from neat-o, check it out. As an open participant, I consider all elements neat-o and I do what I want but I can imagine for an undergrad this could be overwhelming\n\nfurther thoughts about separating reference  / citation / credit information and essential reading. A good scholar should include sources but as a learner it's hard to know what I should read in its entirety. This is an instructional design revelation as I often try to include a lot of links in module materials and now working my way through I can see that it could be confusing.\n\nHow am I feeling about the linearity of these course notes? I have of recent years been expounding the virtues of taking notes in different formats. I suppose I could still be sketchnoting and uploading and linking within here. Yes, I shall do that perhaps as a module summary or if there's an article that really needs deeper meaning-making.\n\nin some sense, not being a historian is problematic. There are codes and terms that I just do not have the requisite background to fully comprehend. For example, the exercise says to go see the epigraphic database heidelberg. I only know what database means there. Upon reading more, I see it's a \"systematic entry of ancient latin and bilingual (latin+greek) inscriptions into a complex database. I do not know latin. My classics friends/colleagues lament the lack of latin comprehending grad students.",

If I wanted instances of transliterated pie characters in the form of pie than I'd have a csv file of that?  oh sweet, all my trauma setting up mkdocs is now paying off now because I already have wget and homebrew wget was so fun and holy crap, it worked the first time splitting the output.txt file kicked out an error, I'm also not motivated to do anything with it yet because i don't really have a keen interest in what I searched.

Also I don't like that urls do not translate from running the mkdocs to build my web facing open notebook I'm a bit overwhelmed with the options. Just choosing a text editor alone seems to be an irrelevant yet overwhelming decision. I have always liked TextMate but it wasn't one of the options. Does it matter? It seems to work fine...so far. But people seem to be religious about their text editors. And that's just the mundane and simple task of creating text files. There seem to be an infinite number of other options for the web publishing. We are using mkdocs but could @getgrav also work? Is bootstrap only the styling or is there something there that could help me create.  Also confused about using gitbub.io page vs my own domain. Should I be doing a push to my github and ghpage and my domain as well? Why so many places?  Did I miss when we were supposed to install omeka? The resources section in slack have a lot of cool and interesting information but it's difficult to discern necessary from neat-o, check it out. As an open participant, I consider all elements neat-o and I do what I want but I can imagine for an undergrad this could be overwhelming further thoughts about separating reference  / citation / credit information and essential reading. A good scholar should include sources but as a learner it's hard to know what I should read in its entirety. This is an instructional design revelation as I often try to include a lot of links in module materials and now working my way through I can see that it could be confusing. How am I feeling about the linearity of these course notes? I have of recent years been expounding the virtues of taking notes in different formats. I suppose I could still be sketchnoting and uploading and linking within here. Yes, I shall do that perhaps as a module summary or if there's an article that really needs deeper meaning-making. in some sense, not being a historian is problematic. There are codes and terms that I just do not have the requisite background to fully comprehend. For example, the exercise says to go see the epigraphic database heidelberg. I only know what database means there. Upon reading more, I see it's a \"systematic entry of ancient latin and bilingual (latin+greek) inscriptions into a complex database. I do not know latin. My classics friends/colleagues lament the lack of latin comprehending grad students.",
